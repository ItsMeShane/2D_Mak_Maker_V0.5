# 2D_Mak_Maker_V0.5
A 2D map editor designed for creating a number map which my game (next project) will convert into a visual map. Contains over 1900 unique 32x32 tiles.

Version 0.5 inccludes the following:

-Multiple bug fixes

-A redo feature (Ctrl + Shift + Z)

-A screenshot button.

This is very close to finished and there will most likely be no more major changes. Possibly some GUI improvements and any other bug fixes if needed
